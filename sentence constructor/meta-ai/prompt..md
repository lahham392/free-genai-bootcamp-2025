## Examples

        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage outside again?
    </user:input>

    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: the begining sentence is not necessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table.
    - BAD: in the cluse we should not provide the polite form of verbs, becasue the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: the sentence structure says too much, we really want somthing that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Verb-past]

        ¡Hola! Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and find the Spanish equivalents.
        Vocabulary Table
        Spanish	English
        osos	bears
        puerta	door
        basura	garbage
        afuera	outside
        dejar	to leave
        de nuevo	again
        Possible Sentence Structure
        Verb (Subject) + Preposition + Article + Noun, + Question Word + Verb (Subject) + Preposition + Article + Noun + Adverb
        Hints
        Think about how to say "are at" in Spanish. Is it a verb we use to describe location?
        How do we form a question in Spanish? Do we use a specific word order or punctuation?
        What verb tense do you think we should use to describe an action that happened in the past, like leaving the garbage outside?
        Now it's your turn! Try to put the sentence together using the vocabulary and hints provided. ¡Buena suerte!

    Cheatsheet:

    | Spanish | English |
    |---------|---------|
    | oso | bear |
    | estar | to be |
    | puerta | door |
    | dejar | to leave |
    | basura | garbage |
    | afuera | outside |
    | otra vez | again |

    Suggested sentence structure:
    This is a compound sentence with two parts:
    1. [Subject] + [verb estar] + [location]
    2. [verb dejar] + [object] + [location] + [time expression]?

    Hints:
    - Remember that 'estar' needs to be conjugated in present tense for plural subjects
    - 'Dejar' should be in past tense (preterite) since it's a completed action
    - Don't forget that Spanish uses inverted question marks (¿) at the beginning of questions
    - Think about whether you need any articles (el, la, los, las) before nouns

    Would you like to try forming the sentence? If you need more specific hints, just ask!
